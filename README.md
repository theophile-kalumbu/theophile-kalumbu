- 👋 Hi, I'm @theophile-kalumbu
- 👀 I'm primarily interested in frontend development and developer experience
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how Doctolib works in general (I'm a new joiner 😄) and also learning Dutch 🇳🇱 in my spare time
- 💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on any frontend initiatives. I also love knowledge sharing and contributing to training sessions, workshops, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm at the LVL office on Mondays & Tuesdays, 4th floor near J or I. I'm an early bird, so I'm most active on Slack in the mornings
- 😄 Pronouns: Théo, T.O
- 🔄 I see feedback as a gift—don't hesitate to share, even if it's constructive criticism
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first time I tried skiing was in New Zealand, even though I grew up in France!
- ⚽ Hobbies: I am a football fan and loves playing it
- 🎵 Music: I love afro carribean music and cuban salsa. I also enjoy UK Garage, Grime and more recently South African Amapiano.
